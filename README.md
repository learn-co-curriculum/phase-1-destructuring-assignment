# Destructuring Assignment

## Learning Goals

- Use _destructuring assignment_ to assign data to variables

## Introduction

As developers, sometimes we receive information in a collection (e.g., an
`Object`) and we want to "pick and choose" elements out of the collection. It's
a major pain to individually extract each property / value pair out of an
`Object` and then assign it to a variable.

Destructuring lets us type less and be more clear about what we want to pull out
of an `Object`. Not only does destructuring help when working with data in your
application, it's essential for understanding how to get JavaScript to include
third-party code (like you find on [npm][]).

## Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Data to Variables

In JavaScript, when we want to assign data from an object to single variables,
we know how do it individually like so:

```js
const doggie = {
  name: "Buzz",
  breed: "Great Pyrenees",
  furColor: "black and white",
  activityLevel: "sloth-like",
  favoriteFood: "hot dogs",
};
const name = doggie.name;
const breed = doggie.breed;
name; // => "Buzz"
breed; // => "Great Pyrenees"
```

This is repetitive code. The process is:

1. Declare a variable with a name (e.g. `name` or `breed`)
2. Use that variable's name to point to an attribute in the `Object` whose name
   matches the name of the variable (e.g. `doggie.breed` or `doggie.name`)
3. Assign the attribute's value to the created variable

JavaScript gives us the ability to perform this task with _one_ simple line of
code.

```js
const doggie = {
  name: "Buzz",
  breed: "Great Pyrenees",
  furColor: "black and white",
  activityLevel: "sloth-like",
  favoriteFood: "hot dogs",
};

const { name, breed } = doggie;
name; // => "Buzz"
breed; // => "Great Pyrenees"
```

The `{}` around the variable names tells the JavaScript engine that it's going
to be pulling values from an `Object`. The engine looks inside the `doggie`
object for the attributes `name` and `breed` and assigns the values associated
with those keys to the corresponding variable names. This is known as
_destructuring assignment_. The general syntax is:

```js
const { propertiesToPullAndSave } = objectToPullFrom;
```

Note that because the engine is looking for the attributes by their keys, the
order inside the `{}` doesn't matter — this works as well:

```js
const { breed, name } = doggie;
name; // => "Buzz"
breed; // => "Great Pyrenees"
```

We can also use destructuring assignment with a nested data structure:

```js
const doggie = {
  name: "Buzz",
  breed: "Great Pyrenees",
  furColor: "black and white",
  activityLevel: "sloth-like",
  favoriteFoods: {
    meats: {
      ham: "smoked",
      hotDog: "Oscar Meyer",
    },
    cheeses: {
      american: "kraft",
    },
  },
};

const { ham, hotDog } = doggie.favoriteFoods.meats;
ham; // => "smoked"
hotDog; // => "Oscar Meyer"
```

We've simply "drilled down" to the object we want to access by chaining the
keys: `doggie.favoriteFoods.meats`.

### Using Destructuring Assignment with Arrays

Destructuring does not just work on objects — we can use the same syntax with
`Array`s.

```js
const dogs = ["Great Pyrenees", "Pug", "Bull Mastiff"];
const [medium, small, giant] = dogs;
console.log(medium, small, giant); // LOG: Great Pyrenees Pug Bull Mastiff
```

Note that, this time, we've wrapped the variables we're declaring in `[]`
instead, so the engine knows we're destructuring an `Array`. In this case, the
order _does_ matter: the engine assigns the first element to `medium`, the
second to `small` and the third to `giant`.

The cool part is we can pick the parts of the `Array` that we want to assign!

```js
const dogs = ["Great Pyrenees", "Pug", "Bull Mastiff"];
const [, small, giant] = dogs;
console.log(small, giant); // LOG: Pug Bull Mastiff
```

The initial comma tells the engine to skip the first element and start the
assignments with the second element.

### Using Destructuring Assignment with Strings

We can also destructure with strings by using the
[`String.prototype.split()`][split] method to turn the string into an array:

```js
const dogsName = "Sir Woody BarksALot";
const [title, firstName, lastName] = dogsName.split(" ");
console.log(title, firstName, lastName); // LOG: Sir Woody BarksALot
```

Because the `split()` method returns an array, we can pick and choose just as we
did before:

```js
const dogsName = "Sir Woody BarksALot";
const [title, , lastName] = dogsName.split(" ");
console.log(title, lastName); // LOG: Sir BarksALot
```

### Destructuring in Action

As we've now seen, destructuring is a nice quick and easy way to extract data
from data structures. It's useful in many cases, but let's explore one of the
most common ways it is used.

The scenario you will likely utilize it most, especially when we get to React in
Phase 2, is in passing arguments to functions. For example, say we have a
function programmed to only print a dog's `name` and `breed`. Without
destructuring, we would write:

```js
function printNameAndBreed (dog) => {
  console.log(`${dog.name} the ${dog.breed}`);
}

printNameAndBreed(doggie);
// => Buzz the Great Pyrenees
```

While this works fine, we're passing in more info than our function actually
needs. Additionally, we need to reference the whole `dog` object each time we
access a property. If we use destructuring, we can avoid all of that entirely:

```js
function printNameAndBreed ({ name, breed }) => {
  console.log(`${name} the ${breed}`);
}

printNameAndBreed(doggie);
// => Buzz the Great Pyrenees
```

We still pass in the entire object as an argument when we invoke the function,
but now the function does _not_ have access to any properties outside of `name`
and `breed`. It only extracts the destructured properties.

Additionally, we don't have to use dot notation each time. Of course, in this
small example, using dot notation once or twice is not a huge deal, but the
larger your code grows, the more efficient destructuring becomes.

## Instructions

Take a look in `index.js`. You'll see that we've given you several variables
containing `String`s, `Array`s, and `Object`s. For this lab, you need to write
several destructuring assignments for each. Specific instructions are provided
at the bottom of the `index.js` file. Let the test output guide you through the
process.

## Conclusion

_Destructuring assignment_ is a fast, and efficient way to assign data to
variables from objects, arrays, and strings. It allows us to easily pick and
choose the pieces of data that we want to assign. With practice, you'll be
proficient at it in no time.
